# Welcome to my profile :star2: <br/>

You're looking at repositories created by *@maxschlake*. <br/>

I'm an aspiring **Data Scientist** / **ML Engineer** with a Statistics background and a specialization in sensor signal processing and NLP. After my master, I decided to start uploading my own collection of projects here. <br/>

A bit of information about me: I'm originally from Germany, but I have studied and worked in Spain, Italy and France. I have finally settled down in Grenoble. ðŸ¥³ I'm also a passionate guitar player, who I likes to improvise to fusion or flamenco. :notes: <br/>

My main programming languages are: <br/>
