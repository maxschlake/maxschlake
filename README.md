# Welcome to my profile :star2: <br/>

You're looking at repositories created by *@maxschlake*. <br/>

I'm an aspiring **Data Scientist** / **ML Engineer** with a Statistics background :mortar_board:, and I have decided to collect my projects here. <br/>

A bit of information about me: I'm originally from Germany, but I have studied and worked in Spain, Italy and France. I have finally settled down in Grenoble. ðŸ¥³ <br/>

I'm also a passionate guitar player :notes:, who I likes to improvise to fusion or flamenco. Both programming and playing guitar are activities which do not necessarily contribute to a healthy back, so I *aim* to mitigate any damage by regular visits to the gym.. <br/>

My main programming languages are: <br/>
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54) <br/>
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/r-%23276DC3.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=r&logoColor=white"/> <br/>
![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white) <br/>
